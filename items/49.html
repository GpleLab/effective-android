			<li>Keep the bitmap in memory only with the resolution you need.</li>
			<li>On Android 2.2 (API 8) and lower, when GC occurs, app's thread get stopped, it causes lag</li>
			<li>On Android 2.3, GC works concurrently, memory is reclaimed after bitmap is no longer needed</li>
			<li>API 10 and lower, pixel data is stored in native, separated from the bitmap itself.You need to call recycle() in order to release the memory.</li>
			<li>On android 3.0, pixel data is stored in dalvik heap, no need to call recycle(). GC will handle it</li>
