		<ul>
			<li>Use EventBus to communicate from activity to fragment. Thus you don't have to rely specific fragment</li>
			<li>Use EventBus to deliver network responses</li>
			<li>Avoid casting as much as possible. ie: In fragment, if you call MainActivity, you will be tightly coupled with the main activity class. Avoid doing this. Use abstractions such as interface</li>
