		<ul>
			<li>With java 7, String can be used in the switch cases</li>
			<li>You can use switch in onClick(), I prefer ButterKnife to split methods, more readable with that way</li>
			<li>Use enums/constants to make readable cases</li>
			<li>Use "fall through" approach. When the case is the same with the next one, you can put a comment and tell that it will fall through. This will help the next developer to understand that this is done intentinally.</li>
