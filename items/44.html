		<ul>
			<li>Within a class, accessing a field via getter is 3x slower than accessing it directly. For performance reason you should access to fields directly within the class.</li>
			<li>Without JIT, accessing a direct field is 3x faster than invoking a getter method.</li>
			<li>With JIT, accessing a field directly is same as like accessing a local, accessing a direct field is 7x faster than getter</li>
