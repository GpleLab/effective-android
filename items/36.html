		When uploading image to the server, you can either use binary or Base64.
		<hr>
		<ul>
			<li>Binary data cannot be escaped in JSON. You can use Base64 in that case</li>
			<li>Base64 uses 8 bit format, thus size is %33 more than binary data. Use Base64 when you are sending your image as string in a json body for example.</li>
			<li>If you are sending the data directly, use binary data and use "image/jpeg" or "image/png" for mime type or your specific image type</li>
