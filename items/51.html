			<li>For efficiency and performance use libraries. As a thumb rule, do not try to implement a high cost operation from the stratch. Libraries already cover most of the common operations such as networking, image operations etc.</li>
			<li>Contribute the library if you think something is wrong or missing instead of creating a new one.</li>
			<li>Create your own if you think you have different features/approach</li>
			<li>Modularize your code in order to make easy maintenance and reusubility</li>
